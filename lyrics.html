    <h2>By Frank Sinatra</h2>
    <p>
      And now, the end is near <br />
      And so I face the final curtain<br />
      My friend, I'll say it clear<br />
      I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br />
      I've lived a life that's full<br />
      I traveled each and every highway<br />
      And more, much more than this<br />
      I did it my way<br />

      <br />
      Regrets, I've had a few<br />
      But then again, too few to mention<br />
      I did what I had to do<br />
      And saw it through without exemption<br />
      I planned each charted course<br />
      Each careful step along the byway<br />
      And more, much more than this<br />
      I did it my way<br />
      <br />
      Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br />
      When I bit off more than I could chew<br />
      But through it all, when there was doubt<br />
      I ate it up and spit it out<br />
      I faced it all, and I stood tall<br />
      And did it my way<br />
      <br />
      I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br />
      I've had my fill, my share of losing<br />
      And now, as tears subside<br />
      I find it all so amusing<br />
      To think I did all that<br />
      And may I say, not in a shy way<br />
      Oh, no, oh, no, not me<br />
      I did it my way<br />
      <br />

      For what is a man, what has he got?<br />
      If not himself, then he has naught<br />
      To say the things he truly feels<br />
      And not the words of one who kneels<br />
      The record shows I took the blows<br />
      And did it my way<br />

      <br />
      Yes, it was my way
      <br />
